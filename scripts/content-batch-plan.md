## Content Plan — Titles, Keywords, and Internal Linking

### Status & Next Steps
- Batches 1-5 are live (50 posts published via `batch-publish.sh` using GPT-4.1 + Firecrawl 8-source brief). Supabase is clean—draft leftovers were removed.
- Next up: rerun `scripts/retro-link-posts.js --dry-run` then live to align hubs/cross-links per the plan once any new batches land (open task `link-fix`).
- For reruns, keep the same pipeline: `batch-publish.sh <batch>` with retries + `tmp/response-*.json` capture, then retro-link, then CLI QA of slugs.
- If a new session starts, skim `scripts/README-batch-publish.md` and this plan for the batching flow, retry logic, and citation/linking rules.

### Legend
- **Up**: link to the pillar hub for this post.
- **Cross**: lateral links to related posts (older batch first when possible).
- **Resource**: template/tool posts to reference within the content.
