unauthed user lands on preview, can see there are multiple sections at a glance (maybe tabbed layout for each section) and can clearly see restricted version of full access, and its clear they need to sign up and subscribe to access full version but still gets a good impression of what they will get and are impressed. Signing up puts them in the free plan where they can access everything up to and including all 3 brand voice traits. This matches relume.io where you can get 1 page of wireframes, sitemap, design system and website designs. They can download on free and paid plans but free plan downloads only show what's not restricted.  
signs up and can access dashhboard (1 style guide) and edit up to brand voice section, others are restricted. 
Signs up to pro or team plan and user can update to full the style guide. When they see it, everything is consistent. 
With all plans they can prompt any text changes using a floating prompt field which updates the edit and preview views with a smooth update/light animation. They can also prompt specific changes inline like you can do with platejs (not sure if this is a paid platejs feature)
